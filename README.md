# MinecraftPacketIds

**Update 29th May:** Thanks to Mojang adding packet generation in [1.21-pre1](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-pre-release-1) to the reports data generator, this repo is no longer maintained, and will not be updated. To generate packet IDs from 1.21-pre1 onwards, check out the [Data Generators](https://wiki.vg/Data_Generators) included with the Minecraft server.

Simple repo that stores Minecraft Packet IDs from a generator script.
